### About me 

***

I graduated from the faculty of informatics at KFU, and immediately after graduation I realized that I could open up in this area and develop all my life.

Immediately after the release, I did not understand what kind of technologies I was interested in, but now I am absolutely happy, because I found a craft that brings me pleasure - this is front-end development.

I love learning, learning something new for myself. I am also very purposeful and diligent, so I am sure that I will be able to become an experienced developer.
